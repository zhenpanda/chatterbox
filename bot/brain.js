Design:

  Bot converstaion rotate throught 3 phases

  1. Leading question: To kick off a topic and get the user involved into talking to the bot.
  Example: Have you watched Westworld? I love that show...

  2. Collect: Reading the response from the user.
  Example: User -> "I hate robots..."

  3. Profile Response: Depending on the profile of the bot, it will response back to the user
  Example: I will ignore any rude comment...please behave.

  4. Re-orient: The bot will decide how to go able talking again and start/continue/end the topic.
  Example: Interesting...I got 2 go...good bye.
